# Work Log

## Day 1 (01.20.2026):
- Set up Arduino IDE
- Tested Arduino connection with laptop
- Learned how to use Serial Monitor

## Day 2 (01.22.2026):
- Tested KY-032 sensor
- Connected it to Arduino and checked the output
- Adjusted the potentiometers and observed different behavior

## Day 3 (01.23.2026):
- Tested KY-028 (temperature sensor)
- Observed lower temperature gives high arduino values and higher temperature gives low arduino values.
- Wrote sensor notes and documentation
- KY-001 (Temperature Sensor)
- Connected KY-001 to Arduino (VCC, GND, SIG)
- Installed required libraries (OneWire, DallasTemperature)
- Uploaded the KY-001 code and tested temperature readings in °C
- Observed that the sensor is very sensitive and accurate
- No challenges faced during testing
