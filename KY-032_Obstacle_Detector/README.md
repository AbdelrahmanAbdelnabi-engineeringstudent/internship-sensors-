1. Sensor Description

The KY-032 is an infrared obstacle detection module. It uses an infrared transmitter and receiver to detect nearby objects by measuring reflected infrared radiation. The module processes the signal internally and provides a digital output indicating the presence or absence of an obstacle.

2. Relationship Between the Sensor and the Arduino (ATmega328P)

The KY-032 provides a digital output signal that can be connected to any digital input pin of the ATmega328P microcontroller. The Arduino does not process the infrared signal itself; instead, it reads the final HIGH or LOW output generated by the sensor’s onboard comparator.

Changing the digital pin number in the code does not affect functionality, as long as the selected pin is configured as an input and matches the physical wiring.

3. Working Principle

The sensor emits infrared light using an IR LED. When an object is placed in front of the sensor, the light is reflected back to the IR receiver. This reflected signal is compared to a reference threshold using an LM393 comparator. Based on this comparison, the sensor outputs a digital signal.

Two onboard potentiometers allow adjustment of sensitivity and detection distance by changing the comparator threshold.

4. Experimental Observations

During testing, it was observed that adjusting the potentiometers can invert the sensor’s behavior. In one configuration, the output signal is HIGH when an obstacle is detected. In another configuration, the output remains HIGH by default and switches LOW when an object is detected.

This occurs because the comparator threshold crosses the received signal level. Fine adjustment is required, as small changes significantly affect the output behavior.

5. Role of the Arduino

The Arduino supplies power to the sensor, reads the digital output signal, and sends the detection result to the laptop using serial communication. All obstacle detection logic is handled internally by the sensor module.

6. Conclusion

The experiment demonstrates that the KY-032 is a self-contained sensing system with configurable detection behavior. The Arduino functions as a digital reader and communication interface. Proper calibration of the potentiometers is essential for reliable operation.
